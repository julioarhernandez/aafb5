    "content": "<p>Home gutters are long, narrow tubes used to reroute rain that falls on the roof of a house or building through a down-pipe and out to the drainage system and away from the home. This prevents the ground around the house to become waterlogged and the rainwater from potentially being absorbed into the foundation where it will cause severe damage to the structure, as well as surrounding structures.</p><p>Rain gutters are an easy and excellent way to extend your homes life and take care of your investment.</p><p>Home gutters are most commonly made from vinyl, steel, aluminium and copper.</p>"
