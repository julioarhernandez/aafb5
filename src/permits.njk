<h2 class=\"headerTitle -small -dark mt-5\">You need a permit for your specific town</h2>
<p>The first step in this process is obtaining a permit for the install. Although all towns require this as the number one step, you need to double-check with the specific application and codes unique to where your home is. Although a majority of the codes and requirements are the same, there are some differences between cities within Florida as to what is necessary for a home or structure to be considered “safe.”</p>

  Download your City permit
</a>
</p>
<h2 class=\"headerTitle -small -dark  mt-5\">Filling out an application</h2>
<p>Once you figure out the specific permit requirements, you need to have all of the information about the work you want to have done. The information that you will need for an application includes permit type, type of property, square footage, and the reason you want the permit.</p>
<h2 class=\"headerTitle -small -dark  mt-5\">Drop the paperwork at the Building Department</h2>
<p>Regardless of where you live, you need to take the filled out application along with the upfront fees and submit them to the building department in your city. Most of the time this department is located and your town’s city hall building. You will go to a permit counter where you will hand in the notarized filled out and signed application and two sets of plans of the work to be reviewed.</p>
<h2 class=\"headerTitle -small -dark  mt-5\">Get approved</h2>
<p>The process to get your permit could take a good amount of time, especially if you are filing your application at a busy time. This is why planning ahead becomes a vital part of this process. If you plan to have your application submitted well before the hurricane season, it could make this process faster. Your application gets reviewed by a few different departments before it can get approved.</p>
